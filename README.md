# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project

This repository includes R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course provided by Coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

# Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data_avegare.txt , and uploaded in the course project's form.
